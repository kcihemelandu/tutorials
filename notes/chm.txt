Soaps are made from natural ingredients such as plant oils (coconut, palm) or acids derived from `animal fat`

1. Soaps are the sodium salts of carboxyllic acids in long chains
2. Soaps are biodegradeable while some of the detergents cannot be biodegradeable
3. Detergent is a chemical compound or mixture of compounds used as a cleaning agent while soap is a cleaning agent composed of one or more salts of fatty acids

While detergents on the other are synthetic, man-made derivatives such as surfactants, optical brighteners and perfumes

Bonds in Ammonia

NH3 is a covalent compound. Because the bond is formed between 1 nitrogen and three hydrogen atoms by the sharing of electrons. Also, the difference of electronegativity between nitrogen and hydrogen atoms on the pauling scale is not big enough to make an ionic bond in ammonia compound

The electronegativity in hydrogen is 2.2
The electronegativity in nitrogen is 3.04
The electronegativity in carbon is 2.55
Oxygen -> 3.44
Chlorine -> 3.16 
Boron -> 2.04
Iodine -> 2.66
Fluorine -> 3.98

In coordinate covalent is formed when one atom donates one of its extra electron pairs to another atom

both polar bond and non-polar bonds are types of covalent


Bonds in nitrogen

2. Triple bond: Nitrogen has a triple covalent bond. Nitrogen is a non metal. The outer shell of a nitrogen atom contains 5 electrons. Two nitrogen atoms share three electrons each, forming three covalent bonds and making the nitrogen molecule
