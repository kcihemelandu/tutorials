# What do do

## Questions to ask

Define the requirements as abstract concepts (Objects)

Objects can be manipulated and queried using APIs on the server

Data representation need to be stored in databases

1. What protocols do you use for a service?
2. What database do you use
3. Should we use file systems?
4. Whether to use CDNs
5. How do I design my apis
6. What design patterns should be used
7. What itermediate design patterns like Load balancers and message queues.
8. What interactions am I having, like how are we converting data? How are we streaming from the server? Can we stream through a CDN?
