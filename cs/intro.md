# Introduction to CS

The study and design of algorithms, computations and information systems, in both theory and practice, typically with the aid of computers.

Just like telescopes are tools in astronomy, computers are tools in computer science.

## History of Computers

Charles Babbage 1791 - 1871 is widely considered the father of computers. Babbage is credited for inventing the first mechanical computer in the 1800s

Mathematician, Ada Lovelace is credited with publishing the first program in 1840s designed to be used on one of Babbage's early machines.

The first large scale computer was produced over a century later.

In 1945, the ENIAC was commissioned at the university of pennsylvania in philadelphia. It was 9ft tall, covered 1800 sq ft, weighed nearly 30 tonnes and cost 500,000 dollars. Adjusted for inflattion, that's over 7 million dollars in 2021. It had a clockspeed 100000 cycles per second. It can two large numbers together 50000times in one second.

The first personal computers were introduced in 1977 by three different companies known as the trinity. One of the computers was the aple II helped launch the apple company.

In 1982, the Comodore 64, sold 17 million units.It still holds the title of best selling computer

## Internet

A global system of INTERconnected computer NETworks to communicate between devices and other networks. The internet is a network of networks that consists of public, private, academic, business and government networks. It has shaped the whole way we do things.

The world wide web was invented by Tim Lee in 1989 and the public was granted access in 1991. The web allows you to access the internet through a web browser.

## Computer Components

- Hardware: This is the part you can see and touch
  - Input: Provides data into a computer like keyboard, mouse, microphone
  - Output: Printer, Monitor, Controller vibrations,
  - Storage: Retains digital information. RAM (primary), secondary(ROM, Flash drive, CD), tertiary(Cloud storage e.g. google drive)
- Software: Without software, hardware is useless
  - System Software
  - Application Software

## Bits and bytes

Bits are the smallest unit of data. They are ones and zeros. It is short for Binary Digits

A byte consists of 8 bits. Historically it was used to store a single character like the letter R or the number 7.

We refer to a file size in terms of bytes.

## Data Types in Programming

Each data type is designated to store

- Text
- Numeric Data
  - integers
  - floating points
- boolean values
  - true: 1
  - false: 0

## Programming

This is the process of writiing ad designing computer programs to perform specific tasks.

A program is a set of specific instructions written in a specific programming language that a computer follows to complete a task.

A programming language is a special language used to write algoritms that a computer can understand.
Each programming language has its own syntax, rules and logic.

### Syntax

Syntax is the vocalbulary and grammer of a programming language. Special words, punctuation and commands and rules for putting them together.

### Algorithms

A set of well defined instructions, performed sequentially, to complete a task.
