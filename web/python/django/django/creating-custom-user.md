# Creating a Custom User In Django

There are situations where you may want to add extra features to the already
built user model in django or you would like to create a completely new user model

> In the models.py, we create the `User` model and the User model manager
> `UserManager` (for managing the model and adding functionality to it)

```py
from django.db import models
from django.contrib.auth.models import (
    BaseUserManager, AbstractBaseUser
)


class User(AbstractBaseUser):
    email = models.EmailField(
        verbose_name='email address',
        max_length=255,
        unique=True,
    )
    is_active = models.BooleanField(default=True)
    staff = models.BooleanField(default=False) # a admin user; non super-user
    admin = models.BooleanField(default=False) # a superuser

    # notice the absence of a "Password field", that is built in.

    USERNAME_FIELD = 'email'
    REQUIRED_FIELDS = [] # Email & Password are required by default.

    def get_full_name(self):
        # The user is identified by their email address
        return self.email

    def get_short_name(self):
        # The user is identified by their email address
        return self.email

    def __str__(self):
        return self.email

    def has_perm(self, perm, obj=None):
        "Does the user have a specific permission?"
        # Simplest possible answer: Yes, always
        return True

    def has_module_perms(self, app_label):
        "Does the user have permissions to view the app `app_label`?"
        # Simplest possible answer: Yes, always
        return True

    @property
    def is_staff(self):
        "Is the user a member of staff?"
        return self.staff

    @property
    def is_admin(self):
        "Is the user a admin member?"
        return self.admin
```

So what's the `USERNAME_FIELD` exactly? Well that's how Django is going to
recognize this user. It replaces the built-in username field for whatever you
designate. In this case, we decided to opt for an EmailField but you can also
consider using a phone number.

```py
class MyUser(AbstractBaseUser):
    identifier = models.CharField(max_length=40, unique=True)
    ...
    USERNAME_FIELD = 'identifier'
```

```py
from django.db import models
from django.contrib.auth.models import (
    BaseUserManager, AbstractBaseUser
)


class UserManager(BaseUserManager):
    def create_user(self, email, password=None):
        """
        Creates and saves a User with the given email and password.
        """
        if not email:
            raise ValueError('Users must have an email address')

        user = self.model(
            email=self.normalize_email(email),
        )

        user.set_password(password)
        user.save(using=self._db)
        return user

    def create_staffuser(self, email, password):
        """
        Creates and saves a staff user with the given email and password.
        """
        user = self.create_user(
            email,
            password=password,
        )
        user.staff = True
        user.save(using=self._db)
        return user

    def create_superuser(self, email, password):
        """
        Creates and saves a superuser with the given email and password.
        """
        user = self.create_user(
            email,
            password=password,
        )
        user.staff = True
        user.admin = True
        user.save(using=self._db)
        return user

# hook in the New Manager to our Model
class User(AbstractBaseUser): # from step 2
    ...
    objects = UserManager()
```

```sh
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
```

> In settings.py

```py
AUTH_USER_MODEL = 'accounts.User'
```

> Run migrations again

```sh
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

## Accessing the created User

### Normal Way

```py
from django.contrib.auth import get_user_model
User = get_user_model()
```

### But what about User foreign keys? At some point you'll be faced with this situation

```py
from django.db import models


class SomeModel(models.Model):
    user = models.ForeignKey(...)
```

```py
from django.conf import settings
from django.db import models

User = settings.AUTH_USER_MODEL


class SomeModel(models.Model):
    user = models.ForeignKey(User, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
```

## Creating forms for update

> In forms.py

```py
from django import forms
from django.contrib.auth import get_user_model
from django.contrib.auth.forms import ReadOnlyPasswordHashField

User = get_user_model()

class RegisterForm(forms.ModelForm):
    """
    The default

    """

    password = forms.CharField(widget=forms.PasswordInput)
    password_2 = forms.CharField(label='Confirm Password', widget=forms.PasswordInput)

    class Meta:
        model = User
        fields = ['email']

    def clean_email(self):
        '''
        Verify email is available.
        '''
        email = self.cleaned_data.get('email')
        qs = User.objects.filter(email=email)
        if qs.exists():
            raise forms.ValidationError("email is taken")
        return email

    def clean(self):
        '''
        Verify both passwords match.
        '''
        cleaned_data = super().clean()
        password = cleaned_data.get("password")
        password_2 = cleaned_data.get("password_2")
        if password is not None and password != password_2:
            self.add_error("password_2", "Your passwords must match")
        return cleaned_data


class UserAdminCreationForm(forms.ModelForm):
    """
    A form for creating new users. Includes all the required
    fields, plus a repeated password.
    """
    password = forms.CharField(widget=forms.PasswordInput)
    password_2 = forms.CharField(label='Confirm Password', widget=forms.PasswordInput)

    class Meta:
        model = User
        fields = ['email']

    def clean(self):
        '''
        Verify both passwords match.
        '''
        cleaned_data = super().clean()
        password = cleaned_data.get("password")
        password_2 = cleaned_data.get("password_2")
        if password is not None and password != password_2:
            self.add_error("password_2", "Your passwords must match")
        return cleaned_data

    def save(self, commit=True):
        # Save the provided password in hashed format
        user = super().save(commit=False)
        user.set_password(self.cleaned_data["password"])
        if commit:
            user.save()
        return user


class UserAdminChangeForm(forms.ModelForm):
    """A form for updating users. Includes all the fields on
    the user, but replaces the password field with admin's
    password hash display field.
    """
    password = ReadOnlyPasswordHashField()

    class Meta:
        model = User
        fields = ['email', 'password', 'is_active', 'admin']

    def clean_password(self):
        # Regardless of what the user provides, return the initial value.
        # This is done here, rather than on the field, because the
        # field does not have access to the initial value
        return self.initial["password"]
```

## Updating the admin panel to have the features

```py
from django.contrib import admin
from django.contrib.auth import get_user_model
from django.contrib.auth.models import Group
from django.contrib.auth.admin import UserAdmin as BaseUserAdmin

from .forms import UserAdminCreationForm, UserAdminChangeForm

User = get_user_model()

# Remove Group Model from admin. We're not using it.
admin.site.unregister(Group)

class UserAdmin(BaseUserAdmin):
    # The forms to add and change user instances
    form = UserAdminChangeForm
    add_form = UserAdminCreationForm

    # The fields to be used in displaying the User model.
    # These override the definitions on the base UserAdmin
    # that reference specific fields on auth.User.
    list_display = ['email', 'admin']
    list_filter = ['admin']
    fieldsets = (
        (None, {'fields': ('email', 'password')}),
        ('Personal info', {'fields': ()}),
        ('Permissions', {'fields': ('admin',)}),
    )
    # add_fieldsets is not a standard ModelAdmin attribute. UserAdmin
    # overrides get_fieldsets to use this attribute when creating a user.
    add_fieldsets = (
        (None, {
            'classes': ('wide',),
            'fields': ('email', 'password1', 'password2')}
        ),
    )
    search_fields = ['email']
    ordering = ['email']
    filter_horizontal = ()


admin.site.register(User, UserAdmin)
```
