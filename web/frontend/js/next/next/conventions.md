# Conventions

1. When naming your component files, (about.jsx) the convention is to use
   lowercase for the name
2. When naming components, you put the components in a `components` folder and
   you name them with uppercases (Layout.jsx)
3. `_app.js` is where the main container for the app is. It is like the App.js
   of a react app
