# Introduction to DevOps

## What is DevOps

DevOps, a term that we hear more and more in enterprises with phrases such as
"We do DevOps" or "We use DevOps", is the contraction of the words Development
and Operations

DevOps is a culture different from traditional corporate cultures and requires a
change in mindset, processes, and tools. It is often associated with continuous
integration (CI) and continuous delivery (CD) practices, which are software
engineering practices, but also with Infrastructure as Code (IaC), which
consists of codifying the structure and configuration of infrastructure.

> According to Donovan Brown: "DevOps is the union of people, process, and
> products to enable continuous delivery of value to our end users"
