# Introduction To Organic Chemistry

Organic Chemistry was previously the study of compounds made from plants and animals i.e. only substances that can be produced from living matter. This definition underwent a radical change when a german scientist known as **Frederik Wholer** prepared an organic compound **(Urea)** $(NH_4)_2CO$ from inorganic matter.
<!-- (in 1825 using ammonium cyanate). -->

Generally now, organic chemistray can be defined as the study of organic compounds.

Organic compounds are compounds of carbon with the exception of the oxides ($CO_2$ and $CO$) of carbon, carbonates $(CO_3)^{2-}$, tricarbonates $(HCO_3)^-$ and metallic carbide $CaC_2$.

## COMPOSITION OF ORGANIC COMPOUNDS

1. Carbon (Main Component)
2. Hydrogen
3. Oxygen
4. Nitrogen
5. Halogen
6. Phosphorus
7. Sulphur
8. Metallic Elements

## GENERAL PROPERTIES OF ORGANIC COMPOUNDS

Organic compounds are numerous in the universe due to the exceptional abilities of carbon

- Catenation: This is the ability of carbon atom to link up with itself to form a straight chain or branched chain
  - ![Single Bond](./../assets/images/Annotation%202022-09-13%20140707.png)
  - The above is a straight chain
- Multiple Bond: Carbon has the ability to form single, double or triple bonds with one another
- Co-valence: Most of the organic compounds are covalent in nature. This accounts for their low melting and low boiling points
- Solubility: Most organic compounds are insoluble in water with the exception of those that contain -OH,-COOH,-NO_2,-Cl,â€¦
- Flamability: Most of the organic compounds are highly flammable i.e. they burn exothermically in a plentiful supply of air to form CO_2 and water
- Thermal instability: Most of the organic compounds are highly unstable. They decompose at higher temperatures into smaller organic molecules. This principle is known as Cracking and it is used in the petroleum industry
- Reactivity: Most of the organic reactions are generally slow because they lack mobile ions, they usually require heat, catalysts or thorough mixing to speed up the reaction rate. Carbon has the ability to react easily with most metals and non-metals to form a variety of compounds. This is because the electronegativity value of carbon is 2.5 which is between the highly electropositive metals and the highly electronegative non-metals
