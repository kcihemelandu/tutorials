# ALKANES

These are aliphatic hydrocarbons (organic compounds ) with the general molecular formula

$$
C_nH_{2n-2}
$$

Where $n≥1.$

They are `SATURATED` hydrocarbons. They are also known as `PARAFFINS` (meaning little affinity). They are relatively less reactive compared to their unsaturated counterparts.
The simplest member of the alkanes is `methane`.
> Alkanes are `sp3` hybridized

## METHANE

This is the simplest member of the alkanes. It has a molecular formula $CH_4$.

Methane is known as a `marsh gas` because it is usually found in pond or swampy environments or found in the atmospheres surrounding swamps, marshes or stagnant ponds.

Methane is also known as `firedamp` gas because it is highly volatile and very explosive.

> Firedamp is a combustible mine gas that consists chiefly of methane.
>
> Also defined as the explosive mixture of this gas with air

Methane is responsible for the major explosions in the coal industry.

Methane is also formed when coal or wood is heated strongly in the absence of air in a process called `destructive distillation of coal`

### PREPARATION OF ALKANES

---

#### LABORATORY PREPARATION OF METHANE

- Alkanes can be obtained by the alkaline hydrolysis of an alkanoate salt.

Methane can be produced in the laboratory by heating sodium ethanoate with soda lime.

CH3COONa + NaOH → CH4 + Na2CO3

> Soda Lime $CaHNaO_2$ is a mixture of `quicklime` $CaO$ and `Caustic Soda` $NaOH$
>
> **Note:** Soda lime is preferred to ordinary caustic soda because it is not deliquescent

NB: In the laboratory preparation of methane, the delivery tube should be withdrawn from the reaction flask immediately after heating so as to prevent water from sucking back into the reaction flask

- Methane can also be obtained by treating aluminium chloride with a hot dilute acid.
- Reaction between haloalkanes and reducing agents
- The Kolbe system: This involves the use of carboxylic acids.

PHYSICAL PROPERTIES OF ALKANES

1. The straight chain alkanes C1 – C4 are gases at 20⁰C. C5 – C17 are liquids at 20⁰C. C18 and above are solids at 20⁰C
2. Boiling point increases with an increase in relative molecular mass (RMM) although branching tends to reduce boiling point
3. The melting point also increases with an increase in RMM
4. The density of alkanes also increases with an increase in RMM
5. All alkanes are less dense than water
6. Alkanes are generally insoluble in water but soluble in non-polar solvent such as trichloromethane (Chloroform), benzene etc. Methane however shows a slight tendency to dissolve in water because of its small size (relatively insoluble)
7. Methane is a colourless, odourless and a tasteless gas.
8. Methane shows no action on litmus paper
9. Methane is Slightly Soluble in water
10. It is less dense than air

CHEMICAL PROPERTIES OF ALKANES

- Combustion: All alkanes undergo combustion to form carbon (IV) oxide and water.
$$
CnH_{2n+2} + (3n+1)O_2 → nCO_2 + (n+1)H_2O
$$
- Substitution reaction: This reaction is common to all saturated compounds. It can be defined as the direct displacement of an atom or group of atoms
  - Halogenation: This reaction is between halogens and alkanes. It is a typical substitution reaction. This reaction occurs in three stages
    - Chain initiation
    - Chain propagation
    - Chain termination
  - Methane undergoes halogenation reaction with fluorine, chlorine and bromine. It does not undergo halogenation with iodine. The halogenation of all higher alkanes takes place at slower rates that that of methane. The halogenation reaction can only take place in the presence of light (sunlight) and never in the dark. It is therefore a photocatalytic reaction.

- Nitration of alkanes: The vapour phase nitration of alkanes using trioxonitrate (V) acid takes place at 150⁰C to 400⁰C to produce Nitroalkanes.

## USES OF ALKANES

- Methane is used as a fuel either alone or when combined with other gases.
- Methane is used industrially to produce hydrogen
- Trichloromethane also known as Chloroform which is a derivative of methane is used in the laboratory to preserve specimen
- Chloroform is also used as an anaesthetic.
- Tetrachloromethane is an important solvent used in dry cleaning
