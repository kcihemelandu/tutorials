# Iconography

Iconography is a visual language used to demonstrate aspects, content or functionality. Icons are meant to be simple and clear, visual elemnt that are recognisable immediately.

You do not have to redisign "well-known" icons such as Home icon, Search icon, etc. You can get access to almost all kinds of icons on websites for free or at reasonable costs.

If you specifically need icons for your project, you should design icons which are in harmony with your design and other icons.

Keep in mind that icons need to be understood easily by users, so make sure to show consistency in your design.
