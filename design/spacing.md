# Spacing

Consistency plays a key role in UI design. So when you are designing, you need to measure everything and keep it constant.

As a designer, spacing is up to you but once you set it, you need to use the same spacing patterns in your designs

For example, if you set the spacing between the header and body text to 8px, you should always use the same spacing throughout your project.
