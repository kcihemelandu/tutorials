# Visual Noise

This is about a screen or part of a digital product which has so much information and many elements on it.

When you are designing an app or a website, you may need to pay attention to details a lot because by the end of the day, we want to design a screen which is user-friendly and easy to walk through.

So make sure to eliminate al the unncessary elements or information from your screen. If you are not sure whether your design has visual noise or not, it is recommended to ask for users' feedback.
