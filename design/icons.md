# Icons

You may think that working with icons is an easy part of the UI design, however, if you do not pay attention to details, you will not get an appropriate result.

## Points to take note of

- Test Scalability: Check if your icons can still be recognised at small sizes such as 15 \* 15px
- Properly sized: The recommended target size for touchscreen objects is 7-10mm. Also, remember to add padding between icons to prevent incorrect taps
- Internal Consistency: Use the same color scheme for all icons and also the same styling attributes (such as the size of the borders)
- Perfect alignment: Always try to have perfect alignment in iconography but sometimes because you have icons with different sizes you need to balance them by yourself.
