# Visual Hierachy

Visual hierachy is about how we look at designs. Content in any digital pae layout will pursue a particular hierachy. For instance, menus go to the top, bottom, left or right of the screen (or a combination of these). Headers appear above body text.

Hierachy is a simple way of staying organised from most to least important

Remember that users define the hierarchy of any app or website. The item that first grabs the user's attention is at the top of the hierarchy.

The visual specifications that a designer can utilise to influence users' understanding of the information are:

- Size: The larger the element, the more attention it will attract
- Color: Bright colors are more notable than muted ones
- Alignment: An element with a different alignment of others will attract more attention.
- Contrast: Sharply contrasting colors will catch the eye easily
- Proximity: Elements which are placed closely together appear more related
- Repition: Repeating styles can indicate the content is related
- Whitespace: More space between elements will draw more attention to them.
