# Typography

Typography transforms language into a decorative visual element

Typography is one of the most important parts of UI/UX design so it is worth your time to learn more about it.

When you are designing, limit the number of typefaces and sizes that you use in order to keep your designs simple. Start with two fonts at most. One for the headers and the other for the bodies.

You can use free or paid fonts in your projects. Yo need to tell your clients to pay for paid fonts.
