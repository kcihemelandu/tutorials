# Wireframing

This is a way of design an app at a structural level. It is used to layout content and functionality on a page which take user needs and experiences into account. It can be called a graphical skeleton: Like a blueprint.
It determines the details of the whole project at the initial stage as the product description.

Wireframing and prototyping are not the same. Wireframe is low-fidelity design and prototyping is high fidelity, dynamic and interactive and almost looks like the final product.
