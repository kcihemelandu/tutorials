Here's a comprehensive 8-week study plan for learning C++, focusing on the core concepts that will enable you to start building projects, followed by 5 project suggestions of increasing difficulty:
Week 1: Basics and Environment Setup

Setting up a C++ development environment (compiler, IDE)
Basic syntax and structure of C++ programs
Variables, data types, and operators
Input/output operations
Control structures (if-else, switch)

Week 2: Functions and Loops

Function declaration and definition
Function parameters and return types
Scope and lifetime of variables
Loops (for, while, do-while)
Breaking and continuing loops

Week 3: Arrays and Strings

One-dimensional and multi-dimensional arrays
C-style strings vs. std::string
String manipulation functions
Introduction to vectors

Week 4: Object-Oriented Programming (Part 1)

Classes and objects
Constructors and destructors
Access specifiers (public, private, protected)
Member functions and data members

Week 5: Object-Oriented Programming (Part 2)

Inheritance
Polymorphism
Virtual functions
Abstract classes and interfaces

Week 6: Memory Management and Pointers

Stack vs. heap memory
Pointers and references
Dynamic memory allocation (new and delete)
Smart pointers (unique_ptr, shared_ptr)

Week 7: Standard Template Library (STL)

Containers (vector, list, map, set)
Iterators
Algorithms (sort, find, binary_search)
Function objects and lambda expressions

Week 8: File I/O and Exception Handling

File input/output operations
Exception handling (try, catch, throw)
Custom exceptions
Best practices for error handling

After completing this 8-week core learning period, here are 5 projects of increasing difficulty to help you apply and expand your C++ knowledge:

Console-based To-Do List Manager (Beginner)
Description: Create a simple console application to manage a to-do list, allowing users to add, remove, and view tasks.
Key concepts: Basic I/O, strings, vectors, loops, functions
Simple Text-based Adventure Game (Beginner-Intermediate)
Description: Develop a text-based adventure game where players navigate through rooms, interact with objects, and make choices that affect the story.
Key concepts: Classes, inheritance, file I/O, control structures, pointers
Library Management System (Intermediate)
Description: Build a program to manage a library's book inventory, user accounts, and borrowing/returning processes.
Key concepts: Classes, inheritance, file I/O, STL containers, exception handling
Custom Image Processing Library (Intermediate-Advanced)
Description: Create a library for basic image processing operations like resizing, rotating, and applying filters to images.
Key concepts: File I/O, dynamic memory allocation, operator overloading, templates, bitwise operations
Multi-threaded Network Chat Application (Advanced)
Description: Develop a client-server chat application that supports multiple simultaneous users and implements basic encryption for messages.
Key concepts: Networking, multi-threading, synchronization, encryption algorithms, smart pointers
