# Machine Learning

1. Build a model or engine
2. Give it a lot of data

## Steps
1. Inform Data usually in csv
2. Clean the Data like removing duplicates
3. Split the data into training and test sets
4. Creating a model (using an algorithm to select our data)
5. Train our model
6. Make predictions
7. Evaluate the predicts and try to improve the model

## Libraries and tools
1. Numpy
2. Pandas
3. MatPlotLib
4. Scikit-Learn
