# Introduction to Machine Learning

Machine learning is the most exciting field of computer science. It would not be
wrong if we call machine learning the application and science of algorithms that
provides sense to the data.

Machine Learning (ML) is that field of computer science with the help of which
computer systems can provide sense to data in much the same way as human beings
do. In simple words, ML is a type of artificial intelligence that extract
patterns out of raw data by using an algorithm or method. The main focus of ML
is to allow computer systems learn from experience without being explicitly
programmed or human intervention.

### Machine Learning Model

Before discussing the machine learning model, we must need to understand the
following formal definition of ML given by professor Mitchell:

“A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some
class of tasks T and performance measure P, if its performance at tasks in T, as
measured by P, improves with experience E.” The above definition is basically
focusing on three parameters, also the main components of any learning
algorithm, namely Task(T), Performance(P) and experience (E).

In this context, we can simplify this definition as: ML is a field of AI
consisting of learning algorithms that:

- Improve their performance (P)
- At executing some task (T)
- Over time with experience (E)
