# Structs

This is a data structure that can store different data types. Like image classes
in some other programming languages.

```c
struct Student {
    char name[50];
    char major[50];
    int age;
    double: gpa;
}

int main()
{
    struct Student student1;
    student1.age = 22;
    strcpy(student1.name) = "Kingsley";
    // Notice how we deal with the strings
    // Recall that it is actually an array
    student.gpa = 3.2
}
```
