# Introduction to C

## History and Characteristics

- It was designed by Dennis Ritchie in 1972
- Its extensions are .c and .h
- It was created to make assembly language much easier to work with
- It is a procedural language
- It is one of the fastest programming languages
- It has handles low level activity very well
- It was used to create the UNIX OS and RDBMS MYSQL is written in C

## Your first program

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main()
{
    printf("Hello world!\n");
    return 0;
}
```

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
```

```c
// This main is the main method of the program
int main()
{
    printf("Hello world!\n");
    return 0;
}
// This will be run when we run our program
```

## Running a program

- Building or Compiling:
  - Taking the written text and converting it a data understandable by the
    machine
- Running the built file

## printf

This prints something out in

## Notes

- Instructions are separated by semicolons
- Order of instructions matter
