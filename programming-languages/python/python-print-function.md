# The `print` Function

The `print` function is used to output data from a variable, string or any
operation or data_type

```py
name = "Kingsley"
age = 18
print("Hello world");
#Hello world
```

```py
print(name + " is a boy")

#The above is concatenation
#You are combining a variable and a string

# Output:
#     Kingsley is a boy
```

You should note that you can't concatenate a string with a number

```py
print(name+" is", age)
```

Notice that we used a comma to add the age to the print in order for it not to
give us an error

```py
print("*" * 10)
#Output: **********
```
