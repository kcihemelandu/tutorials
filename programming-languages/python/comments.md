# Python Comments

A comment is used to add comments to your code to make it easier to understand.
Anything that is a comment doesn't run

## Single Line Comments

A single line comment can be made using the pound sign (#)

```py
#print("Hello world")
```

This won't run because it is a comment

```py
print("Hello world") #comment about this code

#The code will run but that comment will not show
```

## Multiline comments

Multiline comments can be made by using multiline strings

```py
'''
def my_func():
    print("Hello")
'''
my_func()

#The action won't be carried out because the definition of the function was commented out
```
